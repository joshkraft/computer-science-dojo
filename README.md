# Computer Science Dojo

A TypeScript project aimed at teaching computer science concepts through test driven learning (TDL).

## Usage

The project uses a command line interface to delete function/method bodies and/or documentation from a file, leaving it up to the user to fill in the code required to get the tests to pass. To start the test-driven learning process, clone the repository and run the following:

```
npm install

npm run practice
```

This will install the required dependencies and start the CLI, where you can select the concept you want to learn and begin the test-driven learning process.

## Contributing

This project is still a work in progress, and contributions are welcome. If you are interested in contributing, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
