# Computer Science Dojo

A TypeScript repository aimed at teaching computer science concepts through "test driven learning".

## Usage

The project uses a command line interface to delete function/method bodies and/or documentation from a file, and it is up to the user to fill in the code to get the tests to pass. To start the test-driven learning process, run the following command:

```
npm run practice
```

This will start the CLI, where you can select the concept you want to learn, and begin the test-driven learning process.

## Contributing

This project is still a work in progress, and contributions are welcome. If you are interested in contributing, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
